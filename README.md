## Description
- The Quantified Self (QS) is the process of collecting, monitoring, quantifying and self-tracking various aspects of daily life through various technologies, such as wearable devices and applications (Swan, 2013). Quantified self-tracking has continuously been a trending scientific approach since the rise of technology and digitization, which has enabled us to measure and collect sufficient amounts of data in terms of our health, emotions, habits and diet in our daily life efficiently and rapidly. In doing so, QS aims at improving individual’s mental health and physical and emotional productivity and performance and as well as providing insights and further orientation to individuals’ own life by collecting and analyzing relevant data collected using technology (Lupton, 2016).

- In terms of the following context, this project explores the procedure of collecting two group-based data and one individual-based data, data collection methodology, storage of those data and data quality. Furthermore, this project analyses data collected from our small group and individual, using visualization techniques and subsequently evaluates and reflect about data ethics and privacy issues and limitations and reflection of QS project. In particular, the project includes some appendices, supporting additional information of contents and the ODI Data Ethic Canvas. The fundamental purpose of the project is to provide a broad understanding of QS and its application in wider data science practice.

- Refer to the report for the process of data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization and presentations of the outcomes.
